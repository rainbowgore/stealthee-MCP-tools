![Stealthee Logo](./mcp-stealthee.png)

Stealthee is a dev-first system for surfacing pre-public product signals - before they trend.
It combines search, extraction, scoring, and alerting into a plug-and-play pipeline you can integrate into Claude, LangGraph, Smithery, or your own AI stack via MCP.

Use it if you're:

- An **investor** hunting for pre-traction signals
- A **founder** scanning for competitors before launch
- A **researcher** tracking emerging markets
- A **developer** building agents, dashboards, or alerting tools that need fresh product intel.

## What's cookin'?

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- API keys for external services (see Environment Variables)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone and Setup**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rainbowgore/stealthee-MCP-tools
   cd stealthee-MCP-tools
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**

   Fill the `.env` file with your API keys:

   ```bash
   # Required
   TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_key_here
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
   NIMBLE_API_KEY=your_nimble_key_here

   # Optional
   SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=your_slack_webhook_here
   ```

3. **Start Servers**

   ```bash
   # MCP Server (for Claude Desktop)
   python mcp_server_stdio.py

   # FastMCP Server (for Smithery)
   smithery dev

   # FastAPI Server (Optional - Legacy)
   python start_fastapi.py
   ```

### Claude Desktop Integration

Add to your `config.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stealth-mcp": {
      "command": "/path/to/stealthee-MCP-tools/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["/path/to/stealthee-MCP-tools/mcp_server_stdio.py"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/stealthee-MCP-tools",
      "env": {
        "TAVILY_API_KEY": "your_tavily_key",
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "your_openai_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Running the End-to-End Pipeline

The `run_pipeline` tool orchestrates all other tools to provide complete stealth launch detection.

### Claude Desktop

```
Use the run_pipeline tool: "Run stealth launch detection for 'AI startup funding' with 5 results"
```

### Smithery Playground

```bash
smithery dev
# Use the interactive GUI to configure and run the pipeline
```

### FastAPI

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/tools/run_pipeline" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "stealth AI product", "num_results": 5}'
```

### Parameters

- `query` (required): Search query for stealth launches
- `num_results` (default: 5): Number of URLs to analyze
- `target_fields` (default: ["pricing", "changelog"]): Fields to extract

### What It Does

1. Searches tech sites for your query
2. Extracts content from each URL
3. Parses structured data (pricing, changelog)
4. Scores all signals with AI
5. Stores results in database
6. Sends Slack alerts for high-confidence signals

## üìñ Usage Examples

### MCP Server (Claude Desktop)

The MCP server provides 7 tools that can be used directly in Claude Desktop:

````
# Competitive Intelligence
Use web_search to find stealth launches in the AI analytics space before public announcement

# Market Signal Analysis
Use url_extract on https://startupx.com/roadmap to check for early indicators of a private beta

# Go-to-Market Forensics
Use score_signal to assess how likely a changelog is tied to a stealth product rollout

# Early-Stage Market Mapping
Use run_pipeline to sweep ‚ÄúAI legal tools‚Äù across tech blogs and classify high-confidence signals

# Structured Field Parsing
Use parse_fields to extract pricing and release notes from an early-stage landing page

# Developer Tooling Workflow
Use batch_score_signals to process a backlog of scraped product updates and surface high-priority leads for alerting

# Targeted Tech Discovery
Use search_tech_sites to scan Product Hunt and TechCrunch for signs of emerging fintech launches

### FastAPI Server

Access the API at `http://localhost:8000`:

- **API Documentation**: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- **Health Check**: `http://localhost:8000/health`
- **Tools List**: `http://localhost:8000/tools`

#### Example API Usage

```bash
# Search for stealth launches
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/tools/web_search" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "stealth startup AI", "num_results": 5}'

# Run complete pipeline
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/tools/run_pipeline" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "new AI product launch", "num_results": 3}'
````

## Smithery Integration

This project is **natively compatible with [Smithery](https://smithery.tools/)** ‚Äî a local dev UI and workflow runner for MCP tools. If you're building AI pipelines with Claude, LangGraph, or agentic tools, Smithery gives you:

- Live GUI to test all 7 tools via interactive interface
- Auto-generated forms from tool schemas
- Support for Claude Desktop and LangGraph workflows
- Local tool orchestration + debug view

### üîÅ To use in Smithery:

```bash
# Start Smithery development server (in this repo)
smithery dev

# Or use the playground for interactive testing
python -m smithery.cli.playground stealth_server:create_server

Then open: http://localhost:3000/dev

You'll see all 7 tools from this repo available as interactive cards inside the GUI.

Tool registration is defined in src/stealthee_mcp/server.py using FastMCP decorators.
```

## üî¨ Signal Intelligence Workflow

1. **Search Phase**: Use `web_search` or `search_tech_sites` to find relevant URLs
2. **Extraction Phase**: Use `url_extract` to get clean content from URLs
3. **Parsing Phase**: Use `parse_fields` to extract structured data (pricing, changelog, etc.)
4. **Analysis Phase**: Use `score_signal` or `batch_score_signals` for AI-powered analysis
5. **Storage Phase**: All signals are stored in SQLite database
6. **Alert Phase**: High-confidence signals trigger Slack notifications

### AI Scoring

The system uses OpenAI's API to score signals based on:

- Stealth launch indicators (keywords, timing, context)
- Confidence level (Low/Medium/High)
- Detailed reasoning for the score

## Database Schema

Signals are stored in `data/signals.db` with the following schema:

| Field          | Type    | Description                     |
| -------------- | ------- | ------------------------------- |
| `id`           | INTEGER | Primary key                     |
| `url`          | TEXT    | Source URL                      |
| `title`        | TEXT    | Signal title                    |
| `html_excerpt` | TEXT    | First 500 characters of content |
| `changelog`    | TEXT    | Parsed changelog information    |
| `pricing`      | TEXT    | Parsed pricing information      |
| `score`        | REAL    | AI confidence score (0-1)       |
| `confidence`   | TEXT    | Confidence level                |
| `reasoning`    | TEXT    | AI reasoning for the score      |
| `created_at`   | TEXT    | ISO timestamp                   |

## üîß Development

### Adding New Tools

1. Add tool definition to `mcp_server_stdio.py` (for stdio)
2. Add tool definition to `src/stealthee_mcp/server.py` (for FastMCP/Smithery)
3. Implement handler methods in both servers
4. Register in `execute_tool` method (stdio) and `@server.tool()` decorator (FastMCP)
5. Create JSON schema in `tools/`
6. Add FastAPI endpoint in `fastapi_server.py` (legacy)
7. Update Smithery manifest (legacy)
