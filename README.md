![Stealthee Logo](./mcp-stealthee.png)

Stealthee is a dev-first system for surfacing pre-public product signals - before they trend.
It combines search, extraction, scoring, and alerting into a plug-and-play pipeline you can integrate into Claude, LangGraph, Smithery, or your own AI stack via MCP.

Use it if you're:

- An **investor** hunting for pre-traction signals
- A **founder** scanning for competitors before launch
- A **researcher** tracking emerging markets
- A **developer** building agents, dashboards, or alerting tools that need fresh product intel.

   ```

## Smithery & Claude Desktop Integration

All MCP tools listed above are available out-of-the-box in [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@rainbowgore/stealthee-mcp-tools/). Smithery is a visual agent and workflow builder for AI tools, letting you chain, test, and orchestrate these tools with no code.

### Available Tools

- **web_search**: Search the web for stealth launches using Tavily.
- **url_extract**: Extract and clean content from any URL.
- **score_signal**: Use OpenAI to score a single signal for stealthiness.
- **batch_score_signals**: Score multiple signals in one go.
- **search_tech_sites**: Search only trusted tech news sources.
- **parse_fields**: Extract structured fields (like pricing, changelog) from HTML.
- **run_pipeline**: End-to-end pipeline: search, extract, parse, score, and store.

### How to Use in Smithery

1. **Open the [Stealthee MCP Tools page on Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@rainbowgore/stealthee-mcp-tools/).**
2. Click "Try in Playground" to test any tool interactively.
3. Use the visual workflow builder to chain tools together (e.g., search ‚Üí extract ‚Üí score).
4. Integrate with Claude Desktop or your own agents by copying the workflow or using the API endpoints provided by Smithery.

### Claude Desktop Integration

Add to your Claude Desktop `config.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stealth-mcp": {
      "command": "/path/to/stealthee-MCP-tools/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["/path/to/stealthee-MCP-tools/mcp_server_stdio.py"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/stealthee-MCP-tools",
      "env": {
        "TAVILY_API_KEY": "your_tavily_key",
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "your_openai_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
## Tool Use Cases

**For Analysts & Builders:**

- `web_search`: Find stealth product mentions across the web
- `url_extract`: Pull and clean raw text from landing pages
- `score_signal`: Judge how likely a change log implies launch
- `batch_score_signals`: Quickly triage dozens of scraped URLs
- `search_tech_sites`: Limit queries to trusted domains only
- `parse_fields`: Extract pricing/release info from messy HTML
- `run_pipeline`: Full pipeline ‚Äî search ‚Üí extract ‚Üí parse ‚Üí score


## üî¨ Signal Intelligence Workflow

1. **Search Phase**: Use `web_search` or `search_tech_sites` to find relevant URLs
2. **Extraction Phase**: Use `url_extract` to get clean content from URLs
3. **Parsing Phase**: Use `parse_fields` to extract structured data (pricing, changelog, etc.)
4. **Analysis Phase**: Use `score_signal` or `batch_score_signals` for AI-powered analysis
5. **Storage Phase**: All signals are stored in SQLite database
6. **Alert Phase**: High-confidence signals trigger Slack notifications

## ‚öôÔ∏è FastAPI Server

You can also run this project as a FastAPI server for REST-style access to all MCP tools.

### Base Endpoints

- **Swagger UI**: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
- **Health Check**: [http://localhost:8000/health](http://localhost:8000/health)
- **Tool Manifest**: [http://localhost:8000/tools](http://localhost:8000/tools)

---

### Example Usage

**Search for stealth launches:**

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/tools/web_search" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "stealth startup AI", "num_results": 5}'
```

**Run full detection pipeline:**

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/tools/run_pipeline" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "new AI product launch", "num_results": 3}'
```

### Pipeline Parameters

- `query` (required): Search phrase (e.g. "AI roadmap")
- `num_results` (optional, default: 5): Number of search results to analyze
- `target_fields` (optional, default: ["pricing", "changelog"]): Fields to extract from HTML

---

### What run_pipeline Does

1. Searches tech and stealth-friendly sources using Tavily
2. Extracts raw content from each result
3. Parses structured signals (pricing, changelog, etc.)
4. Scores each result with OpenAI to estimate stealthiness
5. Stores results in local SQLite
6. Notifies via Slack if confidence is high

### AI Scoring Logic

The score_signal and batch_score_signals tools use GPT-3.5 to evaluate:

- Stealth indicators (e.g. private changelogs, missing press, beta flags)
- Confidence level (Low / Medium / High)
- Textual reasoning (used in UI or alerting)

### Database Schema (data/signals.db)

| Field          | Type    | Description                     |
| -------------- | ------- | ------------------------------- |
| `id`           | INTEGER | Primary key                     |
| `url`          | TEXT    | Source URL                      |
| `title`        | TEXT    | Signal title                    |
| `html_excerpt` | TEXT    | First 500 characters of content |
| `changelog`    | TEXT    | Parsed changelog (optional)     |
| `pricing`      | TEXT    | Parsed pricing info (optional)  |
| `score`        | REAL    | Stealth likelihood (0‚Äì1)        |
| `confidence`   | TEXT    | Confidence level                |
| `reasoning`    | TEXT    | AI rationale for the score      |
| `created_at`   | TEXT    | ISO timestamp                   |
